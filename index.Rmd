# Today's items

## ToDo in the morning

- Finalise yesterdays lesson
- Have a look at the demo's below. Just run and see.

## Objective of today

Demonstration of geo-scripting potential. This will be done by providing geo-spatial showcases (e.g. data manipulation, visualization, Analysis). 
Every showcase fill be followed by:
A reflection on what is the interest of using scripting for that particular problem
An assessment of the R knowledge required to perform that particular problem

## Learning outcomes of today:

The objective of that lecture is to provide an overview of the capabilities of scripting to solve common problems of the Geo-Information world. The lesson is organized as a set of examples that you can run, visualize the output and understand how the use of scripting was beneficial to tackling the geo-issue. Following each example a reflection is provided on the interest of using scripting for tackling that particular issue as well as associated scripting skills that were required in the example.

So more specifically, at the end of the day you should:

* Have an overview of what can be achieved using scripting
* Identify a situation where the use of scripting is beneficial over click based approach
* Be able to identify which basic scripting skills are required for different Geo-issues
* Have identified how scripting can benefit your own project e.g. master thesis research questions

# Today's learning Objectives

# Examples

## An automated raster processing chain (from data download to final map)

### The example

### Contribution of scripting

* Reproducibility

### Basic scipting skills required

* String handling
* List queries
* Error handling

## A shiny map

### The example
### Contribution of scripting
### Basic scipting skills required

* dataframe manipulation



# Today's summary

We learned about:

- test
- test

# Assignment

Submit a 1/2 page document where you identify the potential contribution of Geo-scripting for yourself, as well as the specific R or python knowledge you would need to learn about. Keep it short, to the point and structured.

<!--Demonstrate potential
Trigger interest
Help students mapping (in their mind) the concepts and knowledge they will learn and require later in the course
This will be done by providing showcases of about everything (data manipulation, visualization, Analysis). Every showcase fill be followed by:
A reflection on what is the interest of using scripting for that particular problem
An assessment of the R knowledge required to perform that particular problem
This lesson should be structured analogically to the course overall.

Example showcases:
An automated raster processing chain (from raw input (or download) to end product)
Make a reproducible map
Extract features immediately followed by statistical analysis
Communicate result with a beautiful interactive (shiny) map
Bonus: If every showcase is embedded into a real world story, that is definitely a bonus
